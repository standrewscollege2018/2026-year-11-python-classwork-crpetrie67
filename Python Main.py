# print() is a function that outputs whatever is inside the brackets
# numbers can be included directly in the brackets
print(123)

# when printing text, it must be in speechmarks which turns it into a string
print("Hello")

# There are lots of different data types:
# integers, decimalds (floating point numbers)
# text (string), boolean (true or false)

# We use variables to store information
name = "Pluto"
First_name = "John"
last_name = "Smith"
age = 14

# You can include variables inside print() statements
print(name)
# To combine variables with a string, we use f-strings
# The variable goes inside curly brackets{}
print(f"my dog is called {name} and his is {age} years old")

# We use input() to get input from the user
